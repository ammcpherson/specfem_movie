# specfem_movie
A basic python script to generate wavefield simulation movies.

As it is still being written, and I would like to share it as soon as possible, a tutorial is available in this 
[gist](https://gist.github.com/thurinj/80203626475af45d027e20d298993689).

The gist covers the very basic at the moment. I will expand it as a proper doc on this repo as I improve on the code and the tutorial.
